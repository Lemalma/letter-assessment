    <H1>Re: Eileen Dover university<br>application</H1>  
    <p>Dear Eileen</p><br>
    <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's <br> faculty to study as part of your <i>PhD</i> next year. I will answer you question one<br> by one in the following sections.</p><br>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
    <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,<br> however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester;<br> the start dates for each one are as follows:</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 MAY 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <P>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</P><br>
    <p>You can find more information about <ins>important university dates</ins> on our website.</p><br>
    <h3>Subject of study</h3>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility<br> — as long as the subjects fall  in the realm of science and technology. You seem<br> like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just  the kind of person we'd like to<br> have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most<br> intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures<br>exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases<br>(effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> > to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
        <li> <ins>HTML</ins> and <ins>CSS</ins> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>So please came provide information on each of this subjects, including how long<br>you'd expect the  research to take, required stuff and other resources, and<br> anything else we'd need to know? Thanks.</p><br>
    <h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>
    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal<br>dances. To answer your question,  my favourite dances are as follows, with<br>definitions:</p><br>
    <p>Polynesian chicken dance <p>
            A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300<ins>BC</ins>, a  whole<br>village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock<br>to be "fruitful".
    </p></p>
    <p>Icelandic brownian shuffle <p>
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to<br>practice this dance, which involved  huddling close together in a circle on the<br>floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid<br>movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance<br>inspired modern styles such as Twerking.</p></p>
    <p>Arctic robot dance <p>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s<br>believed to have discovered a new dance style characterized by "robotic", stilted<br>movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada.<br>Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because<br>they were really cold</p></p>
    <p>For more of my research, see my <ins>exotic dance research page.</ins></p><br>
    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
